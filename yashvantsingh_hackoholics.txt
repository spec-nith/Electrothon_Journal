My Epic Hackathon Adventure!

My first hackathon ever, and let me tell you, it was mind-blowing! I met tons of incredible teams from all over – from Chitkara University to all the way down in Kerala! We were all there to create, to learn, and it was such a vibrant atmosphere.

Speaking of learning, a huge shoutout to Sahitya Sir from RiseIn! He totally opened my eyes to the world of Web3 – seriously, that stuff is amazing!  Building my project was an epic exploration of tech – Blender, Blynk, C++, the whole gang! It really drove home the point that you don't need to be a tech guru to make something cool.

The organizers, S.P.E.C.? Rockstars!  Their marketing was on point, especially that MLH scavenger hunt – what a blast! And let's not forget the endless flow of snacks, fueling our late-night coding sessions. Huge props to the amazing S.P.E.C. seniors too, especially Utkarsh Maurya sir. They were there for us every step of the way.

This hackathon was an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait for the next one!
